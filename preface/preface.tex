This text is part of the Open Astrophysics Bookshelf.  It is meant to
be written collaboratively by the astrophysics scientific computing
community to share best practices and tips/tricks used in the day-to-day
scientific computing workflow.

This text is starting out as simply an outline, meant to be built up
over time by the community.  Feel free to add to it---simply fork the
project's github repo, edit, and issue a pull-request to merge your
contributions back to the main source.

Eventually we'll work on organizing it and writing introductory sections
to each of the main topics.
